# Copilot Instructions for Yarn Projects

- Use `yarn install` to install dependencies.
- Use `yarn add <package>` to add new dependencies.
- Use `yarn remove <package>` to remove dependencies.
- Use `yarn run <script>` to execute scripts defined in `package.json`.
- Always commit your `yarn.lock` file to ensure consistent dependency resolution.
- For workspace projects, use `yarn workspaces` commands to manage packages.

# Terminal Operations

- Use the terminal for delete file operations (e.g., `trash <file>` or `trash -r <folder>` with trash-cli).
